# Final Portfolio

This repository is a collection of some of my key learnings during my 2022 - 2023 apprenticeship at Multiverse with American Express.

## Overview 
I joined the Multiverse apprenticeship in order to jump start my career in software engineering. During my time at American Express and Multiverse I have been able to gain so much knowledge, meet new people, and start my career. I have really enjoyed working and being a part of my team at American Express.
